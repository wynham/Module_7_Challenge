# Module 7 Challenge

This is the repository for my module 7 challenge. In this module challenge, we built a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

Our first step in this challenge was to analyze Paypal, one of the stocks in the ETF. Next we used advanced SQL queries to optimize data access and further analyze Paypal's stock. The next step was to analyze the performance of the entire ETF. Lastly, we used the Voila library to display or notebook in a web app.

## Example

This image shows how we launch the Voila web app from the terminal. Notice how we type in "Voila etf_analyzer.ipynb" into the terminal. The web app then launches.

The following image shows what the Voila web app looks like. In this part we see a graph of the Paypal stock cummulative returns.

This final image also shows what the Voila web app looks like. In this part we see a graph of the entire ETF cummulative returns.
